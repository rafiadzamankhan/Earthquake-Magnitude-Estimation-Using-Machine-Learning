# 🌍 Earthquake Magnitude Estimation

This project explores the use of **machine learning models** to estimate earthquake magnitudes based on **seismological and geographical data**.
The study applies multiple regression techniques — including Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, XGBoost, and Neural Networks — to identify patterns in seismic datasets (features like depth, latitude, longitude, signal strength, and ground intensity indices).

The goal is to improve **prediction accuracy** and support the development of **early-warning systems** and **disaster preparedness strategies**.
